     (e.g. C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\)
     (or in Vista it may be: Start->Computer->Public then /Games/World of Warcraft/)

  4. Copy/Extract this addon's folder into the AddOns folder.
  
  5. The final path should be simailar to this: C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\Addons\GuildLaunchProfiler\
  
  6. The directory above will have the following files in it: GuildLaunchProfiler.lua, GuildLaunchProfiler.toc and README.txt

===============================================================================
Verification
===============================================================================

  The following folder paths will exist within your WoW Install directory:

    GuildLaunchProfiler:
    Interface\AddOns\GuildLaunchProfiler\

  Look for the following (wrong) files as evidence of common mistakes:

  * If you have Interface\AddOns\GuildLaunchProfiler.lua
    ... then you've extracted the zip file's contents without its
        folder structure, or copied the contents without the parent
        folder.

  * If you have Interface\AddOns\GuildLaunchProfiler\GuildLaunchProfiler\GuildLaunchProfiler.lua
    ... then you've extracted the zip file into a folder an extra
        level deep. Move the files and any sub-folders up one level
        and remove the extra folder.
